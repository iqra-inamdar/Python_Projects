# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Analysis (Python Project)

## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing **E-Commerce sales performance** using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights from raw sales data by performing data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. 
The analysis helps understand sales trends, profitability, customer segments, and product performance, supporting **data-driven decision-making** for business growth.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses popular Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn** to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate interactive and static visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives

This project aims to answer the following key business questions:

1. Calculate the **monthly sales** of the store and identify which month recorded the **highest** and **lowest** sales.
2. Analyze sales based on **product categories** and determine which category has the **highest** and **lowest** sales.
3. Perform detailed sales analysis based on **sub-categories**.
4. Analyze **monthly profit trends** and identify the month with the **highest profit**.
5. Evaluate **profit by category and sub-category** to understand profitability distribution.
6. Analyze **sales and profit by customer segment** to identify high-performing and underperforming segments.
7. Analyze the **sales-to-profit ratio** to assess margin efficiency across segments.

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported the E-Commerce dataset into Python using Pandas

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Converted date columns into proper datetime format
   * Handled missing and inconsistent values
   * Created new features such as Order Month and Year for trend analysis

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed total sales and profit
   * Studied sales distribution across segments, categories, and sub-categories
   * Compared sales and profit using bar charts and ratios

4. **Trend Analysis**

   * Monthly sales trend analysis using line charts
   * Segment-wise and category-wise performance comparison

5. **Data Visualization**

   * Bar charts for sales and profit comparison
   * Line charts for time-based trends
   * Pie charts for contribution analysis
   * Interactive visuals using Plotly for better insights

## 📈 Key Insights

* Certain **customer segments generate high sales but lower profit**, highlighting margin issues
* **Monthly sales trends** reveal seasonality and peak demand periods
* A few **product categories contribute most of the revenue**, while others underperform
* Sales-to-profit ratio helps identify **high-volume but low-margin areas**

**Conclusion**

This E-Commerce Sales Analysis project successfully transforms raw sales data into meaningful business insights using Python.
Through structured data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, the project provides a clear understanding of sales trends, profit behavior, customer segments, and product performance.

The analysis identifies seasonal sales patterns, highlights top-performing and underperforming product categories and sub-categories, and reveals how profitability varies across customer segments. 
By examining the sales-to-profit ratio, the project also uncovers areas where high sales volumes do not necessarily translate into strong profits, emphasizing the importance of margin optimization.
The **E-Commerce Sales Analysis** project demonstrates practical use of Python for real-world business analytics. By transforming raw data into actionable insights through structured analysis and visualization, this project showcases strong skills in **data analysis, problem-solving, and business interpretation**.
